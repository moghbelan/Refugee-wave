            A Short Note from the Publisher
          </h3>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-800">
            A refugee, conventionally speaking, is a person who has lost the
            protection of their country of origin and who cannot or is unwilling
            to return there due to well-founded fear of persecution.
            <br />
            <br />
            Migrants, unlike refugees who cannot safely return home, can return
            home if they wish. This distinction is important for governments
            since countries handle migrants under their own immigration laws and
            processes. Many people abuse the refugee law for migration.
            <br />
            <br />
            It is unfortunate that many politicians support this abuse in
            refugee-receiving countries to strengthen their puppet governments
            against the protesting people who are really in danger every day and
            have no way to flee from danger.
            <br />
            <br />
            This also creates a wrong concept in public opinion in the
            refugee-receiving country.
            <br />
            <br />
            In the end, I believe the refugee-receiving countries should notice
            that this behavior is not supporting human rights but supporting
            criminality in both countries.
            <br />
            <br />
            Here, I created this place for exchanging opinions and ideas that
            can help to stop criminality for a better world for everyone in this
            life.
