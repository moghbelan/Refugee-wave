Overview
Refugee-Wave is a platform for individuals seeking information about asylum procedures, immigration processes, and refugee policies in host countries. It also serves as a resource for those who wish to provide legal guidance and support to vulnerable individuals in need, fostering a compassionate and informed community.

Objective
Among all the crises that the media has drawn our attention to, I want to be an alarm bell for those who are ready to wake up and recognize their own power—the power to save someone from drowning, to bring hope to eyes and ears that are fixed on the question of whether they will live long enough to see another sunrise or experience a moment of peace somewhere.

Goals
Pointing out to presidents and political parties—the real problem is your failure to manage both your country and the world. This mismanagement has led to migration. If you continue prioritizing economic and military competition over human well-being and fail to take responsibility, even for your own citizens, migration will persist despite the vast resources available on this planet.

Budget
Capital required:$ 1000,000 000
Time required: 5 year

Schedule
-1 Introduction Section – Present an overview of the platform.
-2 Building Awareness & Unity – Bring people together under one goal: to understand that being a refugee is not a disaster—anyone could become a refugee.
-3 Development & Global Connections – Connect with people worldwide who can provide support and assistance.
